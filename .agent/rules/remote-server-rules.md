1. On this project I'm working on a server I can only access by a team viewer so there is no possibility for you to interact with the system where I run inference and where the code is ultimately run. If we debug the running code, you need to tell me what to do and ask me for information. 
2. To communicate with llms try to use langchain for llm interaction where possible.
